Good job! You relaly put in effort, a couple of things i noticed on the UI:

- still missing guest log in, when companies browse through candidates they
    likely will not sign up with an email, so its easier to get them to your
    main faster if you add a guest visit feature.
- layout could use some work
  * footer should have like your signature or contact on it, not functionality,
      those goes in app header
  * Search should be in the body and not the app header
  * Nice Logo
  * Login and Register should just be one button in the header
- Upload page should also be showing what's currently available, so upload
    feature could just be on the index page of the musics
